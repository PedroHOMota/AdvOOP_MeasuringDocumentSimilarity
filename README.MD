## Object Oriented Programming Project 2017

This repository contains code and information for a forth-year undergraduate project for the module **Object Oriented Programming** taught by John Healy.
The module is taught to undergraduate students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie) in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics.

The project had the following requirements:
>1. A document or URL should be specified or selected from a web browser and then
dispatched to a servlet instance running under Apache Tomcat.
>2. Each submitted document should be parsed into its set of constituent shingles and
then compared against the existing document(s) in an object-oriented database (db4O)
and then stored in the database.
>3. The similarity of the submitted document to the set of documents stored in the
database should be returned and presented to the session user.
